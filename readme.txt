== Description ==

This plugin enables your users to sign-in with their Google/Yahoo/Facebook and
other social identities. Our key design point is simplicity, you can get your
site up in literally under 60 seconds, and there is no 3rd party sites to
visit or configure.

Our service is completely free for low traffic sites. If your site grows in
the future, we also offer advanced features for a moderate price,
such as the following:

* Extended profile attribute capturing
* Pre-built integration, with email marketing, and content management systems
* Programmable integration, with various language support
* Full identity management suite, with user, role, and permissions management

We believe our implementation, focusing on simplicity, is superior to others
in the same space. But we are still new and would appreciate your
feedback. Please feel free to comment/rate us here on WordPress, or
write us for whatever issues you encounter at help@sumilux.com

== Installation ==

1. Copy the `ssi` directory and its contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
